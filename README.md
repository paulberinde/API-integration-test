API usage example - Destiny 

App built around the Destiny (Bungie) API ( https://www.bungie.net/platform/destiny/help/ ) used to track player data.
This implementation takes in a user name, and returns a MembershipID first; based on the MembershipID it then provides two further pieces of information:

- Grimoire Score ( a numeric representation of the in-game lore discovered by the user) 

- Version of the Game they're playing (The Year One version, which can include all DLC up to House of Wolves, or Year Two, also called "The Taken King").
In order to test the app functionality, here is a list of user names:

- PaulBerinde - Year Two Account, low Grimoire Score

- SecretPandaMan - Year Two Account, high Grimoire Score

- Namx13 - Year One Account 

- Heimsz - Year One Account
